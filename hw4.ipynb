    "** Answer **\n",
    "\n",
    "** a) **\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot obtain given matrix using only left multiplications. The problem arises due to $0$ at $(1, 3)$. A Householder reflector is only able to introduce zeros to lower triangular entries. Similarly, Givens rotation is also not enough to add a zero to $(1, 3)$ without disturbing rest of the matrix. So, (i) is not the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When right-multiplications are involved, we can derive the given matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose input matrix is $A = \\begin{bmatrix} x & x & x \\\\ x & x & x \\\\ x & x & x \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A_1 = Q_2 Q_1 A Q_3^* $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where;\n",
    "\n",
    "* $Q_1$ is Householder reflector generated with $1^{st}$ column of A which introduces zeros in column one.\n",
    "* $Q_2$ is Givens rotation generated with $(2, 2)$ and $(3, 2)$ entries which introduces zero at (3, 2).\n",
    "* $Q_3$ is again a Givens rotation generated with $(1, 2)$ and $(1, 3)$ entries which introduces zero at (1, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, answer is (ii).\n",
    "\n",
    "** b) **\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that entries with $x$ can actually hold a value of zero, you can see that matrices in part (a) and (b) are not too different.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can obtain given matrix with permuting $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ columns of the matrix in part (a). Thus, (ii) is also valid for this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "** c) **\n",
    "\n",
    "Since given matrix is singular, it is not possible to obtain it from a nonsingular matrix using only unitary matrices. Thus, the answer is (iii)."
